# jsun-party-parrot
This is an example project forked from https://github.com/flounder4130/party-parrot.

Somehow I cannot get the above repo configured properly in my Intellij, so I just copied all files into my newly created Gradle project in my Intellij.

1. set the max heap size to be a smaller number by going into Intellij -> Run -> Edit Configurations -> Add VM options: `-Xmx64m`
2. Run `Parrot` program from your Intellij as Debug mode again, then go to View -> Tool Windows -> Profiler, right click on Parrot process, then click `CPU and Memory Live Charts`
